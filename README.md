## Partical JS

React-particles is a library for React applications that allows you to easily add particle effects to your web pages. Particle effects are small, individual particles that can be combined to create visually stunning and interactive backgrounds or other visual elements.

React-particles is built on top of the popular particle.js library, which provides a wide range of customization options for creating unique and engaging particle effects.
